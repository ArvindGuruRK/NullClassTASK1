# TASK 1
# Visualize Activation Maps

For my internship tasks related to the Emotion Detection project, Task 1 focused on visualizing activation maps to gain insights into the image regions that activate specific filters in the pre-trained model for emotion detection. This task aimed to enhance interpretability by identifying the features and patterns the model relies on for classifying emotions. Using the pre-trained model, I generated activation maps to analyze the areas of interest, such as facial landmarks, expressions, and subtle texture variations that contribute to emotion recognition. Key features extracted included the position and shape of the eyes, mouth, and eyebrows, as well as overall facial structure and symmetry. This task provided a deeper understanding of the model's decision-making process and helped to validate the effectiveness of the extracted features in detecting emotions. A GUI was not required for this task, allowing a streamlined focus on model visualization and analysis.
